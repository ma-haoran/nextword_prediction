This application is developed as part of the requirement for the Coursera Data Science Capstone Course. The goal of the project is to build a predictive text model combined with a shiny app UI that will predict the next word as the user types a sentence similar to the way most smart phone keyboards are implemented today using the technology of Swiftkey.


The source codes for ui.R and server.R files are also available on the GitHub repo: [code](https://github.com/ma-haoran/nextword_prediction)

Presentation Slide decks are available on the RPubs page:
