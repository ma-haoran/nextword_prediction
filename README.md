# nextword_prediction

## Describing the Project
The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others.

The raw data for this project can be downloaded from (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip). 

"Tidytext", "Datatable", "tidyverse" packages are used to tidy the raw and build the training data. For details please refer to file "algorithm.r".

The final project was concluded with one Shiny application and a Pitch using R-Presentation.
